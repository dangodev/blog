It‚Äôs been a little over a year since Chris Coyier‚Äôs post [_The Great Divide_][css-gd] came out, the
first blog post I remember reading that drew a line in the sand between two distinct camps (armies?)
of front-end developers. Which I guess are, like, at war with each other, or something:

> On one side, an army of developers whose interests, responsibilities, and skill sets are heavily
> revolved around JavaScript. On the other, an army of developers whose interests, responsibilities,
> and skill sets are focused on other areas of the front end, like HTML, CSS, design, interaction,
> patterns, accessibility, etc.

In that year following the post, more of us have begin to see these spheres of expertise pulling
apart, whether this post opened our eyes, or we witnessed the same patterns Chris did.

**But what if the divide was actually made up?** What if, instead of a divide, we just collectively
admitted that front-end development is bigger, and more complicated than we originally thought? If
we recognized that doing JavaScript _well_ was harder than anticipated, and that it took smart
cookies with Computer Science (CS) degrees a couple decades to push the ecosystem closer to where it
needed to be?

This post is an appeal to view it all as one, core knowledge, and one core role (albeit big as
hell). Maybe it‚Äôs harder to attain true mastery than we originally thought. But isn‚Äôt that what
makes it deep, and exciting, and satisfying to try?

I started thinking about this subject again recently when a backend developer reached out to me,
wanting to learn about modern front-end dev (they hadn‚Äôt really kept up for the past, oh, 6 years or
so). In listing out all the things they could learn, I noticed **three** (not two) major groupings
started forming. In my mind this not only lays a groundwork for possible starting points, but
distinct axes of mastery to pursue the more you commit to front-end.

So here are the three pillars to front-end development, not in any particular order, that your
journey should cross into at some point:

## üë®‚Äçüé® Pillar 1: Browser APIs & Rendering (HTML/CSS)

The pillar of Browser APIs & Rendering revolves around two central questions: **On the web, how do I
make things look like things?** and **How does a browser work to help me accomplish this?**

At beginner levels, browser rendering involves understanding the fundamentals of HTML & CSS to get
code to look like a design. At intermediate levels, this gets into animations, render profiling, and
making interactive things perform adequately in a browser environment. At the highest levels,
mastery of browser rendering means being able to describe in great detail how assets are requested
and the priority of their loading, the browser paint API, and how to render anything‚Äîeven 3D‚Äîat 60
frames per second (the [maximum a browser will allow][surma-120fps]).

For the traditional CS student, the browser is something that often gets underestimated. This
results in the common ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand CSS‚Äù state of confusion that so many backend developers
find themselves in. And it _is_ confusing, until you treat the browser as the special, weird runtime
environment that it is. Often times it‚Äôs what you‚Äôre fighting with here‚Äîyour own misconceptions of
what the browser is doing.

Take the following with a grain of salt, but here is roughly how you might track growth of your
knowledge in this area:

### Beginner

| Skill                             | Example                                                                                       |

_¬≤ related to Pillar 2 / ¬≥ related to Pillar 3_

You may find that much of the ‚ÄúCSS Dev‚Äù from the _Great Divide_ post fits in here, with the addition
of JavaScript like `fetch` and `history`, and the omission of CSS frameworks like [SMACSS][smacss].
So already we‚Äôre breaking up that division! As for CSS framework knowledge, that fits more neatly
in‚Ä¶

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Pillar 2: JS Programming & Architecture

The pillar of JavaScript & Architecture is the recent development of front-end into a more formal,
proper software environment from web dev‚Äôs _laissez-faire_ ‚Äújust throw that code anywhere‚Äù
beginnings. This roughly correlates with the JavaScript-oriented type in Chris‚Äô post somewhat, and
is closer to the comfort sphere of a traditional Computer Science education. Whereas Pillar 1 trends
toward static display, Pillar 2 adds dynamism, automation, and interaction. You could even call this
‚Äúthe backend of front-end.‚Äù

This pillar is concerned with **How should this application be interacted with?** and **How should
code for the front-end be organized for delivery and team maintainability?** The pursuit of these 2
questions, together, have led to many milestones such as that React thing you‚Äôve heard so much about
(along with Node.js, which we‚Äôll cover more in the last pillar).

Though JavaScript is one of the most popular programming ecosystems, it‚Äôs still developing. And for
that reason I don‚Äôt feel comfortable dividing intermediate- and master-level topics. Everyone‚Äôs
journey through here will differ, and for that reason, I only distinguish between basics and
non-basics.

In your rebuttal of this blog post, please be gentle with this section ;)

_¬π related to Pillar 1 / ¬≥ related to Pillar 3_

In JavaScript‚Äôs strange, strange development, something very weird happened that few could have
predicted: _JavaScript turned into a backend language with Node.js._ This not only changed how we
_prepared_ JavaScript for the browser (Pillar 1); it also changed how we wrote it (Pillar 2).

Let‚Äôs be clear: _Node.js is a backend language._ In this post we‚Äôre not talking about the backend,
but we can‚Äôt deny that Node.js has changed the front-end ecosystem forever with advanced tooling to
npm. And this knowledge makes up the final pillar.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pillar 3: The Toolchain (Node.js, npm, Babel, bundlers)

The final pillar‚ÄîThe Toolchain‚Äîconcerns itself with the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù parts of front-end development. Its
concern is: **Can the way we develop web applications be improved?** and it‚Äôs given rise to [module
systems][esm], [package managers][npm], [transpilers][babel], [bundlers][webpack], and even [new
languages][jsx].

While this pillar is the slipperiest to understand, because by its very nature it questions the
ontology of front-end development, it‚Äôs also the most powerful because it has the ability to
transform how we work. For beginners that have started their front-end journey fairly recently, all
the kooky toolchains probably comprise the bulk of their learning curve. And for many, they won‚Äôt
truly develop a deep understanding of this until they‚Äôve worked in at least several different
environments and contexts. Once they do, intermediates that understand the lay of the land can
deftly rig up any development pipeline to fulfill a need. Toolchain masters shape the direction and
the future of the common tools we all use.

_¬π related to Pillar 1 / ¬≤ related to Pillar 2_

Usually when complaints arise about the state of front-end development, whether that‚Äôs how much it‚Äôs
changed, or if it‚Äôs too complicated, usually JavaScript gets the blame when really it‚Äôs the
toolchain. Of course, this is confusing, since JavaScript is both the engine that runs the toolchain
(Node.js) and the input/output of the toolchain itself (browser JS).

This is also the pillar that‚Äôs undergone the biggest changes of front-end development, and it won‚Äôt
be settling any time soon. Still, now‚Äôs the perfect time to jump in and contribute _because_ all
these things aren‚Äôt settled yet.

## A final note on mastery

Hopefully you noticed the superscript ¬πs, ¬≤s, and ¬≥s linking skills in one pillar to another.
Hopefully, too, you started to get confused about where the barriers lay between the pillars, and
what kept them as distinct. And, hopefully, you realized that all this knowledge feeds into itself,
and any one pillar is incomplete, and can‚Äôt support a standing structure without the others.

Mastery itself is a slippery thing. I‚Äôm reminded of Matt Might‚Äôs post, [_The illustrated guide to a
Ph.D._][phd] To merely reach the limits of human knowledge is not enough; we‚Äôre all pushing to try
and make that little ‚Äúdent‚Äù in the shape of what‚Äôs possible. And with that act, we leave behind a
bigger world to explore for the next generation.

While this post was meant to paint a more unified, comprehensive view of front-end development, it‚Äôs
not meant to guilt you into figuring all this stuff out on your own. That‚Äôs impossible. You won‚Äôt
master everything, but even theoretically if you could, it would only last for a short time until
someone came along and changed what‚Äôs possible with their dent.

So above all else, **be kind to yourself,** and pursue mastery only to the extent it‚Äôs rewarding for
you and others around you. And while it‚Äôs OK to know different things than everyone else, for the
love of God, don‚Äôt create more ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù rhetoric.
